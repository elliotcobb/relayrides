RelayRides project by Elliot Cobb

I built this from scratch over the past week or so. It was fun learning the smallest sliver of angularJs (I can see why people are so excited about it) and incorporating my old knowledge of Bootstrap, PHP, etc. I know it said to only spend a few hours on this, but I wasn't able to pull myself away until I thought it was ready for showtime. I'm the kind of perfectionist who can't leave a project half way through so it still bugs me that I can't work on the color and look of the site more :) Thanks for the challenge!
